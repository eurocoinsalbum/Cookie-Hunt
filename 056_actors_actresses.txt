🍪 Actors and Actresses
You will get the names of 10 very famous actors and 10 very famous actresses but oh-no I mixed up the names.
Start with Bruce and follow the chain until you visited all 20.
While doing so write down the numbers and letters.
DON'T post the correct sequence here but send me an email!!! NO IB!!!
example: "0A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J" Your sequence will start with a "0" and must exactly have 20 characters overall
First correct email will get 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
Second 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
Third 🍪🍪🍪
Every other correct until 16:45:00 🍪
At 16:45:00 I will publish the correct answer - watch out for this!!! ;-)

For every sent answer I will publish here if your answer was correct or not!
You are allowed to send more than one answer but only your last one counts!!!
So if you've been wrong I will post it here and you can try again.
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE 3 ATTEMPTS!!! Sending more than 3 will disqualify you!!!
You are not allowed to retract messages!!!

Game will start at 16:30 - now you have time the read the rules ;-)

Again: don't post any answer here!!!
