❄-Climb-The-Mount-Everest
Once a month we meet virtually and climb stair cases for exactly one hour.
1 floor approx 2,5m. My personal record is 280 floors in exact 60 minutes.
In one month we combined this with a donation event: when we reach together the height of the Burj Kalifa we will donate what we announced before.
We usually connect via a video conference system and update live the number of floors in a shared spread-sheet.

  1- 10 floors = ❄
 11- 30 floors = ❄❄
 31- 60 floors = ❄❄❄
 61-100 floors = ❄❄❄❄
101-140 floors = ❄❄❄❄❄
141-300 floors = ❄❄❄❄❄❄
