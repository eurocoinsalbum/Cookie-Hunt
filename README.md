Great games to play in a chat with your friends and team mates

These are the games I came up with after we started to work from home. On our first WFH day I organized a short game in our office chat which was really fun and I continued to do so every day...until today...and I will continue until we're back in the office. In every game people got 🍪 for solving the puzzles or being just faster than all the others. The company I work for and the head of our Engineering department have been so kind and spent a present for the first one who got 100 🍪 = 1 🚚 and some goodies for those with 50+ 🍪! Then we started again. By end of 2020 we finished the 3rd round and now started with "A New Hope" into 2021 our 4th round.

After such a long time I thought it's time to share my best ideas with you and hope you enjoy them and encourage you to play those with your friends and team mates.
Have fun!
