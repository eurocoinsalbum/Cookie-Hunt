Great games to play in a chat with your friends and team mates

These are the games I came up with after we started to work from home. On our first WFH day I organized a short game in our office chat which was really fun and I continued to do so every day...until today...and I will continue until we're back in the office.

After such a long time I thought it's time to share my ideas with you and hope you enjoy them and encourage you to play those with your friends and team mates.
Have fun!
