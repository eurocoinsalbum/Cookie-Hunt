When someone reached approx 70 I started playing Robin-🍪-Hood once a week

Robin-🍪-Hood
It's time to take from the rich and give to the poor.

The Rules:
If the Sheriff was faster than you he is protected and you will steal a 🍪 from the next one on the leaderboard until your own position.
Successful or not - you will be honored with a 🍪 for your own box.

Disclaimer (NO duplicates, ONE post only):
One 🍪 per person only. Every name is accepted only once. If you post more than one name you will not get any 🍪 but a 🍪 will be taken from you for every name you posted and the names you posted will be free to be used by others!

And today we play:
🍪-sweets
Post your favorite sweets until 13:04:00 and win a 🍪!
